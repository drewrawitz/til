# Faster npm install

*Update:* npm was updated in January and this is no longer an issue!

~~Executing the following before an npm install dramatically speeds up the process:~~

```
~~npm set progress=false~~
```

~~You wont see a beautiful progress bar but you will get faster installs which, in my opinion, is an excellent trade off!~~
